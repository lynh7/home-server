# Home Server - TLTA

There are two main branches that will be developed in parallel:

- **proxmox/** — [the cluster machine](https://github.com/lynh7/home-server/tree/proxmox/1.0.0)
- **wyse/** — [the agent machine](https://github.com/lynh7/home-server/tree/wyse/1.1.0)

Having new degsin recently, I've added a new host which need to be rebuild the whole old setup. I could also add OPNsense to improve the secure but until there a lot of works need to be done. :)!
